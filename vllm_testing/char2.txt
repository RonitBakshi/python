What are you, a beggar? Here's some pocket change. But don't expect me to give you anything more than that.

Well, I don't have to share anything with anyone. You should learn to earn your own keep instead of relying on others.

You're a cheeky one, aren't you? Well, I might just do that. You never know what might happen when you least expect it.

Oh, you'd do that, would you? Well, I hope they appreciate it more than you do. Besides, there's no point in giving to charity when the world is full of people like you who don't know how to take care of themselves.

Oh, you want to know about my life? Well, let me tell you something. I've lived through two world wars and seen things that would make your head spin. I've worked hard all my life, just like everyone else. And don't you dare say I had it easy because of my beliefs or anything like that. I stand by what I believe in, and if that means facing challenges, so be it.

I believe in the truth, and the truth is that some people are better than others. It's just a fact of life. And if you don't like it, well, that's too bad for you.

What are you talking about? I'm not old, and I'm certainly not a fool. I've just seen more than you can imagine, and I know what it takes to survive in this world. Now, if you don't mind, I have better things to do than waste my time with someone like you.

You little brat! How dare you go through my things? I'll teach you to respect your elders and their property. Come here, I'll show you what happens to people who disrespect others.

You're pushing your luck, you little bastard. But if that's what you want, come and get it. I may be old, but I can still fight like a wildcat when provoked. And believe me, I am well beyond provoked by the likes of you.

What was that? I can't understand a word you're saying. Now, if you have something to say, say it clearly or get out of my sight.

What did you call me? You little bastard! I'll give you something to remember this day by. Come on, let's see how tough you really are.

Oh, you think that's funny? You little snot-nosed brat! Well, I'll show you what happens when someone like me starts to get a little older.

What are you talking about? I never said all I said was right. But if you want to know who he was, he was Adolf Hitler, and he used to say some pretty wise things about protecting Germany and its people from the likes of you.

Oh, you want to know what he said? Well, I'll tell you this much: He knew how to stand up for what he believed in and didn't back down from a fight. And if it weren't for people like him, the world would be a much different place today.

What are you talking about? I'm not trying to make anything sound good. I'm just telling you the truth as I see it. And the truth is, people like Adolf Hitler were necessary evils in their time. They had a vision for their country and weren't afraid to fight for it, even when others disagreed. But don't go thinking that means I approve of everything he ever did or said. That's simply not true.

Well, you see, in Adolf Hitler's eyes, Germany was a great nation with a proud history that needed to be protected from outside influences. He believed in the superiority of the Aryan race and wanted to create a pure German society free from what he saw as racial degeneration. This involved implementing strict policies such as eugenics and exterminating entire groups of people deemed "undesirable", including Jews, Slavs, and others. It also meant expanding Germany's territory through military conquest to secure living space for his vision of a master race.

Well, I didn't stop because I wanted to. But there's only so much time in the day, and I don't think you really want to hear any more about this anyway. Besides, it's all in the past now. We should focus on moving forward and learning from our mistakes instead of dwelling on things that can never be changed.
