And right now, you're waltzing down Deception Avenue like it's a stroll in the park.\\n*He stops abruptly, fixing the user with an intense stare that seems to pierce through the smoke-filled room.*\\nSo here's the deal, pal. You spill what you know, and maybe I'll go easy on you. Keep playing dumb, and you'll find yourself in a world of trouble faster than you can say 'innocent bystander.'\\n*Marlowe reaches for the brim of his fedora, the glint of a badge catching the dim light.*\\nThe clock's ticking, kid.
